# Thank-The-Bus-Driver
Automatically thanks the bus driver in Fortnite based on reading the screen, turning it into an edge detected image, and comparing it to another edge detected image.
Only works in 1080p and 1440p, should automatically detect based on the set windows resolution (not in game resolution).
Can set your emote bind, but won't work on special cases such as tab, ctrl, shift, etc.
